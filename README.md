# PIN_MATRIX_4x4
Design for a 4x4 diy pin matrix

Make two, turn one at 90' to the other and join with a bolt, using a nut as a spacer between the two boards.
Now you can use 2mm banana plugs as patch pins, I push these bannnanas into M3 spacers with a bit of Nylock to make a nice little pin.

Tested and working.
